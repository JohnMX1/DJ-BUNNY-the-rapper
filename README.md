Follow exactly the notes to get more points!
(Freestyle may be added in future updates)
 
# Currently Includes:
- The main game ✓
- The MegaXEngine (or MXE) ✓
**(used for the songs charts, stages, characters. Made to be highly customizable)**

# MXE
The highly customizable engine made for DJ Bunny The Rapper. Highly inspired by ***Friday Night Funkin'*** and inspired by ***Parappa The Rapper 2***
## **What can it Do?**
- Songs;
- Sounds;
- Sprites;
## **How does it function?**
It's based of the Ini, [sprite_add](https://manual.gamemaker.io/lts/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Manipulation/sprite_add.htm)  and [audio_create_stream](https://manual.gamemaker.io/lts/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Audio/audio_create_stream.htm) functions from GMS2.
It can handle infinite mods, but with the exception of only 1 mod per time.
### **Where is it used, for example**
- Everywere in the game! all sounds and sprites are included on the [**mainfiles**](https://github.com/JohnMX1/DJ-BUNNY-the-rapper/tree/master/datafiles)
folder, which should be the same for mods.



# May Include on Future:
- In-game __Chart__, __Stage__ and __Character__ Editor

# Extra Things:

- To clear up future confusions, **Gamemaker Studio 2** is the Engine I used to **make** the game. **MegaXEngine** Is the name I gave the part that **handles the Game's audio, sprite and code** (yet to be added).

- You can learn how to use the game's MXE with the documentation I provided on the Wiki.
